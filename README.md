# trafficConferencePage

The Congress of Online Advertising

Is based on an online website with the first 2 sections:
1. The home page.
2. The about page.

Each of these pages have versions for 2 different screen sizes:

Mobile: up to 768px wide.
Desktop: 768px or wider.

## interactions

The home page have a link in the menu to the about page.
The logo in the header links to the home page.

Mobile menu
When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.  it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).

The mobile menu have a close (X) button that closes the menu.

## Dynamic page

The section "Featured speakers" was created dynamically in JavaScript.
I use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
